# RC2014-Keyboard

Arduino sketch for RC2014 Mini Keyboard

The program is derived from code written by and copyright Dave Curran of Tynemouth Software (http://blog.tynemouthsoftware.co.uk/2012/02/arduino-based-zx81-usb-keyboard.html) and subsequently modified by SmittyTone (https://github.com/smittytone/ZX81Alt) before being further modified by me.

This code allows the use of 2 modifier keys, shift and symbol shift so that each key has 3 values - typically lower case, upper case and a symbol.

It runs on a standard Arduino Uno (ATMEGA328) with serial output at 115200 baud, although the USB keyboard commands can be uncommented to use through a Leonardo or similar.

The layout is a cross between ZX81, ZX Spectrum and whatever I felt fitted with the RC2014

The keyboard is available to buy in kit form from Tindie (hyperlink to apper here soon).

The .dxf and .svg files are available to cut your own case and key cover for this keyboard.  For the two top layers you probably want to use 2mm acrylic, although depending on they height you mount the tactile switches, you might prefer 3mm thick middle layer.  Spacers of at least 5mm should be used between the base and the keyboard PCB.
